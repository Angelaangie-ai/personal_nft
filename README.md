# CO2 Emissions Blockchain Tracker

It is a fact, climate change is the most abundant crisis ever present on the Planet Earth. Individuals and businesses are in a constant run to reduce our carbon footprint and allow a smaller consumption of CO2 emissions. However, on most apps through which we measure carbon emissions, back-end programmers can modify the data and again, greenwash the users without making any tangible impact.

One way through which we can't modify the amount of carbon emissions registered is by using the blockchain technology. This application represents a simple program where a user logs their carbon emissions and automatically saves them to not be edited. 

This application was created on the NEAR Blockchain, which is climate-neutral. This is the first-version of the project submitted for Rewriting The Code Summer Bootcamp.
